# MSc-Project-Explainable-Credit-Risk

This is my Master's Project, a major component of my MSc Artificial Intelligence degree at the University of Edinburgh. This research was performed over June-August 2024, and the repository includes both the codebase and dissertation itself.
If you would like to download and run the code yourself, please read the README.txt file which provides some advice for getting everything set up.

The repository includes:
  - An implementation of several common credit risk models on two datasets, evaluation metrics to assess performance, and SHAP model explanations to obtain feature importance scores. These are used as a baseline for comparison to the novel techniques implemented below.
  - A novel approach to credit risk modelling capable of outperforming the current state-of-the-art using a custom Transformer-based approach.
  - A novel, model-agnostic explainability technique capable of producing local and global feature importance scores faster than other common state-of-the-art xAI techniques, with no decrease in explanation quality, using counterfactuals.

For more in-depth details, feel free to read my dissertation itself, which is contained within the report directory!
